"""Regression tests for duckdb-python#435 and #456.

These reproducers crash the interpreter (SIGSEGV / heap corruption / abort)
when the underlying bug is triggered, so each test runs the workload in a
fresh Python subprocess and asserts on the exit code. A non-zero exit (in
particular -11 / 139 / 134 / -6) is treated as the bug reproducing.

The workloads also report a `success_count` to stdout, and the assertions
verify it crossed a sensible floor — without that, a subprocess that
silently errored on every iteration (e.g. import failure, API change)
would still satisfy a "no crash" check and we would lose the signal we
care about.

These tests spawn subprocesses, so they live under tests/slow rather than
tests/fast.

# #456 — DuckDBPyResult destructor must hold the GIL
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Reporter sees hard crashes on Windows + Python 3.12 under heavy executemany
# workloads with Python primitives flowing into the result graph. The fix
# removes the unconditional `py::gil_scoped_release` from
# `DuckDBPyResult::~DuckDBPyResult` (and tightens the same scope in
# `DuckDBPyConnection::Close` so the `case_insensitive_map_t<unique_ptr<ExternalDependency>>`
# is destroyed with the GIL held).
#
# These tests are skipped off-Windows. We verified empirically by
# temp-reverting the fix and rebuilding that the workloads below do NOT
# crash on macOS/Linux even with the destructor's GIL release restored —
# `Py_DECREF` without the GIL is undefined behaviour but POSIX CPython
# rarely faults on it deterministically (different thread-state storage /
# allocator behaviour from Windows). Running these tests off-Windows
# would always pass regardless of whether the fix is in place, so they
# would be a false signal rather than a regression guard.
#
# On Windows + Python 3.12 (the reporter's environment) the same
# workloads are expected to crash pre-fix and pass post-fix, which is
# what a regression test should do.
#
# Correctness of the fix on POSIX is established by inspection rather
# than by these tests: the destructor's `D_ASSERT(py::gil_check())` already
# requires the caller to hold the GIL on entry, and the previous
# `py::gil_scoped_release` was the only thing dropping it during
# destruction of pybind-managed members.
