"""Correctness contract for the internal NumpyArray façade.

The C++ `NumpyArray` wrapper is the single place that owns the numpy-array
representation (allocate / raw-buffer pointer / resize). It is exercised on two
paths: building a result into numpy (`fetchnumpy`) and scanning a numpy-backed
DataFrame back into DuckDB. These tests pin the properties we rely on:

  * the resize-across-capacity path stays correct -- the result buffer is grown
    by doubling once a result exceeds the initial vector size, and the wrapper
    must refresh its cached data pointer afterwards. A stale pointer here would
    silently corrupt rows past the first resize boundary (not crash), so we
    assert exact element equality across sizes that force several doublings.
  * the `object` dtype works -- strings / nulls / nested values map to numpy
    `object` arrays, which the DLPack-based `nb::ndarray` cannot represent and we
    therefore route around.
  * empty and single-row results don't misbehave at the boundaries.

The wrapper is C++-internal, so it is verified through its observable behaviour
rather than directly. These checks are backend-agnostic (pybind11 or nanobind).
