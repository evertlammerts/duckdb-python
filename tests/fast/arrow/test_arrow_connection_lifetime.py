"""Tests that Arrow streams remain valid after their originating connection is destroyed.

The Arrow PyCapsule paths produce lazy streams — schema and data are consumed
later.  If the stream wrapper holds only a non-owning pointer to the
ClientContext and the connection is GC'd in between, the pointer dangles and we
crash (mutex-lock-on-destroyed-object).

Each test creates a capsule from a short-lived connection, destroys that
connection, then consumes the capsule from a *different* connection.
