"""Regression test for temp views in relations.

`DuckDBPyRelation.query(view_name, sql)` internally calls CreateView, which
writes to the default catalog. On a read-only attached database the write
fails with InvalidInputException, breaking any user pattern that uses
rel.query() against a read-only database.

`rel.select()` and `conn.sql()` don't create a view and work fine, only
rel.query() trips the bug.
